description: This skill should be used when retrieving the default branch name of the current Git repository using GitHub CLI. Use this skill when the user asks "What is the default branch?", "Get the default branch", "What is the main branch?", "Show me the base branch", or when other git operations require knowing the default branch name (e.g., for creating pull requests, comparing branches, or checking out the base branch).
